Set 1 Problem - The Ledger Co
===========================

Problem Context
-------
You work at a startup called The Ledger Co., a marketplace for banks to lend money to borrowers and receive payments for the loans.
The interest for the loan is calculated by I = P*N*R where P is the principal amount, N is the number of years and R is the rate of interest. The total amount to repay will be A = P + I
The amount should be paid back monthly in the form of EMIs. The borrowers can also pay a lump sum (that is, an amount more than their monthly EMI). In such a case, the lump sum will be 
deducted from the total amount (A) which can reduce the number of EMIs. This doesnâ€™t affect the EMI amount unless the remaining total amount is less than the EMI. All transactions happen through The Ledger Co.
You need to design a system to find out how much amount a user has paid the bank and how many EMIs are remaining .
